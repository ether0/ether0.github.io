I am a researcher with a strong interest in X-ray imaging and medical image processing. My areas of expertise include CT image reconstruction and X-ray breast imaging. I also have extensive experience in deep learning-based image processing. My primary interest lies in merging my domain knowledge in X-ray physics with the latest deep learning methods to explore clinical applications.
